# Credible Explorer dApp Prototype

Experimental Credible Wallet is a prototype for credit data on blockchain interactions. 

Interface simulates logic in web layer. Model will be ported into blockchain node API with well defined common interfaces. These will refactor signing, transaction and record storage calls with validation of ownership.

Currently using public testnet. Will be ported to SP permissionless testnet once search, query and retrieve interfaces are onstream (still in spec stage)
