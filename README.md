# Credible Explorer dApp Prototype

Experimental Credible Explorer is a prototype dApp for credit data on blockchain interactions. 

Interface simulates logic in web layer. Model will be ported into blockchain node API with well defined common interfaces. These will refactor signing, transaction and record storage calls with validation of ownership.

Currently using public testnet. Will be ported to SP permissionless testnet on 13.251.25.40 once search, query and retrieve interfaces are onstream (still in spec stage)
